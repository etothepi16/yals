# What is this game?

YALS is an idle game I have been wanting to develop for a while now. I finally decided to just do it, and here is the (hopefully worthwhile) result!

# YALS?

Yet Another Life Simulator

# Why?

¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯

# Can I steal this?

If you pay me.

# Why didn't you add (fancy graphics/multiplayer/famous people/dank memes...)?

Any or all of the following:

- I didn't think it would make sense in the game.

- I tried adding it but it sucked.

- I tried adding it but realized I didn't know how.

- I don't like that thing and you can't make me like it.

- I just haven't gotten around to it yet.

# I have a positive comment

Tell me about it on Twitter/Reddit/wherever you know me.

# I have a negative comment

If it's an actual issue, submit a bug report. If it's something along the lines of "I don't like...." feel free to tell me about it, but don't hold your breath for me to change it. Remember that I am developing this entirely in my spare time, and I'm a one man team.
